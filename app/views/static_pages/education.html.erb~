    <ul>Largest Cash Prize Winner at AngelHack, SF 2015: I wrote the back end for a transactional email service that chooses the most effective emails out of a large possible pool in real-time, based on clicks to the email's “call to action.”</ul>
    <ul
>Designed and implemented k-nearest neighbors machine learning algorithm for hand written letter recognition.</ul>
    <ul>Designed RNA Hairpin loop: Created Python script to take an effector as an input; the output was a sequence
creating a hairpin RNA loop serving as an “on-off” logic gate.</ul>
    <ul>Protein Database web scraper: Created Python script to automate the creation of protein “playing cards,”
including: a picture, stoichiometry, and organism of origin for random proteins from the RCSB protein database.
After scraping the data, the script then wrote HTML and CSS to make the cards printable.</ul>
    <ul>Tested single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) tools: Developed Python script to automate SNP tool testing.</ul>
    <ul>Sliding Block Puzzle Solver: Developed Java script that solved a sliding block puzzle using a breath first
traversal.</ul>
    <ul>Formal Proof Verification Program: Developed Java script that confirmed whether a proof was correct.</ul>
